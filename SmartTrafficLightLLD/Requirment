Smart Traffic Light System
You are designing a smart traffic light system for a city.
The system should dynamically adjust traffic signal durations based on real-time factors like traffic density,
pedestrian crossings, emergency vehicles, and special events (e.g., parades). The system must be flexible enough
to incorporate new rules without modifying existing logic. How would you design this system?
